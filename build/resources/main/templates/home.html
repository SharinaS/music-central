                    <p>MusicCentral is a storage site, not specifically for your music, but for information about your music, such as, your favorite artists, your favorite songs, and the location you like to play those songs. This site plays very well with YouTube - once you add the link to your song on YouTube, you simply slick on that song, and YouTube opens up and plays that song. This site is perfect for those who love music, but who are terrible at remember what their favorite song is called, and who that favorite artist is.</p>
                    <h3>We are under construction! The site is functional, however, and ready to be used.</h3>
